# Your custom Twilio Flex Plugin

Twilio Flex Plugins allow you to customize the appearance and behavior of [Twilio Flex](https://www.twilio.com/flex). If you want to learn more about the capabilities and how to use the API, check out our [Flex documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex).

## Setup

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) as well as [`npm`](https://npmjs.com) installed.

Afterwards, install the dependencies by running `npm install`:

```bash
cd

# If you use npm
npm install
```

## Development

In order to develop locally, you can use the Webpack Dev Server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically start up the Webpack Dev Server and open the browser for you. Your app will run on `http://localhost:3000`. If you want to change that you can do this by setting the `PORT` environment variable:

```bash
PORT=3001 npm start
```
